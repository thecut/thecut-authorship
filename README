The Cut Django App: Authorship

=================
thecut.authorship
=================

To install this application (whilst in the project's activated
virtualenv)::
    pip install git+ssh://git@git.thecut.net.au/thecut-authorship


There is no need to add ``thecut.authorship`` to your project's
``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting, as it provides only abstract models.

Testing
=======

To run the project's tests, first set up a virtual environment for running the
tests::
    virtualenv /path/to/virtual/environment
    source /path/to/virtual/environment/bin/activate

To run the tests for your current environemt::
    python runtests.py

To run the tests against Python versions 2.6, 2.7 and 3.4::
    tox

Note that if you've changed the packages that are required for the app, you'll
need to re-build the tox environment from scratch (see
https://bitbucket.org/hpk42/tox/issue/149/virtualenv-is-not-recreated-when-deps)::
    tox --recreate
